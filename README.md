About the projects contained in this repositorie: 

The MovieWebAppStaj project is my first larger project from 2 years ago to include some html, css and bootstrap improvements. 
It is my first one to have an authentication and authorization system and other similar improvements in functionality. 
This project was creaated on Visual Studio 2019, .NET 5.0.

My next most important project is the one named Skating, which is developed entirely on Visual Studio Code and is my first to include so many new and improved knowledge of frontend web development languages. 
I used it as an example / template / inspiration in the creation of my biggest one so far - namely my diploma project SkateAppWeb, whose backend template / inspo is the WebShopApp project made on Visual Studio 2022, .NET 6.0,
which vaguely includes any frontend but there are big changes on the backend such as the ability to remove registered users, the availability of different roles, filtering by different criteria, 
seeding data in advance, deleting and adding them again when seeding, selling a product, etc.

In the end, after these 2 templates from which I took an example and guided me and after a lot of accumulated knowledge and skills, we come to my biggest project - SkateAppWeb.
It combines perfectly all my knowledge of both frontend and backend web development. With it's awesome optimal design and great unique functionality the project is an excellent software product that fully meets the requirements
I had assigned to it and becomes the perfect web product for the sale of skateboarding goods and accessories. In essence, it is an online web store selling skateboarding goods and accessories.
That project was creaated on Visual Studio 2022, .NET 6.0.

Some of these functionalities are the availability of 2 configurators - one available to all customers and the second only to the administrator, availability of creating reviews, as well as deleting and editing them, 
adding and removing a product from favorites, availability of a promo code when purchasing a product, adding, removing and editing of brands that are pre-seeded,  currency change from BGN to EUR, top button, avalability of sorting and filtering, ect.
